- Puzzles consist of redirecting infinite water streams to water wheels and getting physics objects to some goal

# Cubes and water streams
- Water streams flow infinitely if there are no walls in front of them
- Water streams are redirected using movable cubes [like in Manifold garden](https://youtu.be/GWoRHz-Ri7c?si=CF8YBddAHTTgPjzq&t=3067)
- There are gates/water wheels that the water streams need to be redirected to
- There are different colored water streams that can't flow through each other (also colored gates)

### Cubes and water streams related possible extra mechanics
- Fires that can be extinguished by the water streams
- Player and/or water blocking barriers that can be powered on by cubes 
- Cubes that split water into two directions or reflect water back where it came from
- Do something special where two water streams of the same color cross?
- Play with the water logic:
	-  Make it turn from walls instead of getting blocked by them
-  Make the water into something else entirely
	- Make it able to go up stairs or walls
	- Make it work like [Portal 2 hard light bridges](https://youtu.be/jS605L6mkuM?si=FdL7fVuogNNVYt_V&t=478)

# Moving large objects in the environment
- There are large objects in the environment that can be moved/rotated by grabbing and moving a miniature clone of them (a bit like [these puzzles in Zelda Botw](https://youtu.be/ybNg2clnhR0?si=nxhDGA6oL59dIOIK&t=25))
- The large movable objects can be used to make puzzles with the water, or different kinds of puzzles (like guiding a ball to some goal in Zelda botw)
- Puzzles with movable large objects can also involve walking on the large objects and redirecting water streams with cubes
- Controllable large objects could also be used to make tetromino (tetris piece) space filling puzzles in 3D or in 2D, but this would only make sense if there are some immovable pieces already in place 

# Extra game mechanics outside of the core idea that could still work with this game
- "Alternate" versions of the current level that are just slightly different and you have to go between the two versions of that level to solve the puzzle
- Gravity fields that the player can change the direction of (but isn't supposed to go inside)
- Game mechanics inspired by physical phenomenon like magnetism
- Hard to implement:
	- Time manipulation game mechanics like Braid
	- Working together with clones of yourself like in Talos principle or The last clockwinder

# Ideas for world building, setting the mood and storytelling related to the game mechanics
- Use surprising/strong colors for the "water streams" to go with the mood of some level
- Change the look of the water streams to something else than cartoonish water
- Make a puzzle that makes the player draw some shape with the water
- Make the player smash some object that has emotional/narrative meaning by controlling a large object
- Make the player control a large replica of some object that has emotional/narrative meaning
