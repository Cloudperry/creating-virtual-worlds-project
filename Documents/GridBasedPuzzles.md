# Monster's expedition gameplay
- Puzzle game with interactable objects on a grid like [Monster's expedition](https://youtu.be/lQ9vvjMRe60?si=OlY5XfYWY_Vrjno-&t=52)

# Conversion to VR
- Basically just Monster's expedition (ME) converted to VR and first person
- Player should be free to move anywhere with smooth locomotion or teleportation (not locked to center of grid cells like in ME)
- The interaction with puzzle objects should not be tied to player movement like in ME
- Instead the interaction should be done for example by physically pushing/punching the trees 
- The rules/logic should be extended to allow for hills and height differences
 
# How to make the game unique and not just a copy of ME
- In a way just the conversion to VR and adding the possibility for height differences makes it a new game
- We could add different kinds of interactable objects than just trees (or not use the trees at all)
	- For example small boulders and snowballs
	- The objects would need to have somewhat intuitive (but not realistic) interactions and complex enough interactions to make for compelling puzzles
	- We could do more complex VR interactions for different puzzle objects
- The world doesn't have to be entirely grid-like, but the collisions and interactions between puzzle objects and the world should be possible to approximate by grid cells (or at least marching squares)
 
# Ideas for world building, setting the mood and storytelling related to the game mechanics
- Make puzzle objects that have emotional/narrative meaning
- Put mini museum exhibitions in the levels like in ME 
	- (I think text doesn't work that well in VR, because on some headsets and in some virtual environments it can be hard to read)
